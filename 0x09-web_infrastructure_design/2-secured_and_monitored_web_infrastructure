- Firewall : Firewalls is a network security device that monitors network traffic, it can be understood as a division or 
“wall” between a private network and public network which limits and blocks network traffic based on a set of 
security rules in the hardware or software by analyzing data packets that request entry to the network. Additionally, 
firewalls are used to allow remote access to a private network through secure authentication (Beal, 1996)

- HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, and the traffic is served in order to bring protection by using the secure port 443, 
which encrypts outgoing information. Then it is more difficult to spy or get access to the site’s information.

- Monitoring is practice used for quality control. As Peter Ducker said, “What can’t be measured, it can’t be improved”. 
Then, monitoring not only helps to make sure to maintain high quality levels, keeping the established standards and consistency, 
but also to help in the continuous improvement of the resources performance.

- The way data monitoring is performed, relies on checking new data against predefined rules and metrics. 
If data quality anomalies are detected, an alert is sent in order to give information about the metrics and rules violation, 
so data can be checked (Informatica, 2021).
